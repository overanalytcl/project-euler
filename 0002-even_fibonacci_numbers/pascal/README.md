# Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first terms will be: 
$$
1,\,2,\,3,\,5,\,8,\,13,\,21,\,34,\,55,\,89,\,...
$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Instructions
You need to have the Free Pascal compiler installed and have the executables visible within your `$PATH`. Optional (but highly recommended) is the Lazarus IDE.

You can either do:
```shell
fpc evenfibo.lpr -oevenfibo
./evenfibo
```
or, if you have Lazarus (you can also open this .lpi file and build it from within the IDE and then execute the resulting executable from a terminal):
```shell
lazbuild evenfibo.lpi
./evenfibo
```
