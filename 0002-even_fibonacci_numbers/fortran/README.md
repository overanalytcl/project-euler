# Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first terms will be: 
$$
1,\,2,\,3,\,5,\,8,\,13,\,21,\,34,\,55,\,89,\,...
$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Instructions
You first need to have a Fortran compiler. I have tested this with `ifort` (Intel® Fortran Compiler Classic), `ifx` (Intel® Fortran Compiler) and `gfortran` (GNU Fortran) and it needs to be visible within your `$PATH`. Second, you need to have CMake installed, because this is what builds the project. Once you have those (and are in this directory):
```shell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/evenfibo
```
