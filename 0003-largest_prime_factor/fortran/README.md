## Instructions
You first need to have a Fortran compiler. I have tested this with `ifort` (Intel® Fortran Compiler Classic), `ifx` (Intel® Fortran Compiler) and `gfortran` (GNU Fortran) and it needs to be visible within your `$PATH`. Second, you need to have [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) installed, because this is what builds the project. Once you have those, it's as easy as doing `fpm run`.
