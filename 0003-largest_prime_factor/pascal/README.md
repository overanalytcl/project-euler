# Largest Prime Factor

## Statement

The prime factors of $13195$ are $5$, $7$, $13$ and $29$.

What is the largest prime factor of the number $600851475143$?

## Instructions
You need to have the Free Pascal compiler installed and have the executables visible within your `$PATH`. Optional (but highly recommended) is the Lazarus IDE.

You can either do:
```shell
fpc largestprimefactor.lpr -olargestprimefactor
./largestprimefactor
```
or, if you have Lazarus (you can also open this .lpi file and build it from within the IDE and then execute the resulting executable from a terminal):
```shell
lazbuild largestprimefactor.lpi
./largestprimefactor
```
