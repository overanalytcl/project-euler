# Multiples of 3 or 5

## Statement

If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3,\,5,\,6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.

Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.

## Instructions
You first need to have a Fortran compiler. I have tested this with `ifort` (Intel® Fortran Compiler Classic), `ifx` (Intel® Fortran Compiler) and `gfortran` (GNU Fortran) and it needs to be visible within your `$PATH`. Second, you need to have [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) installed, because this is what builds the project. Once you have those, it's as easy as doing `fpm run`.
