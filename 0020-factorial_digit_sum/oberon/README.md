# Factorial Digit Sum

## Statement

$n!$ means $n \times (n - 1) \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$.

For example, $10! = 10 \times 9 \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800$, and the sum of the digits in the number $10!$ is $3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27$.

Find the sum of the digits in the number $100!$.
## Instructions

You first need to have an Oberon-2 compiler. I have tested this with
voc (Vishap Oberon Compiler), but others might work, YMMV. Then run `make all` 
and `make run`.
