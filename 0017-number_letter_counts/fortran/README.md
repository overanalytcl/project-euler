# Number letter counts
## Statement
If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.

If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

> [!NOTE] 
> Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen) contains $20$ letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

## Instructions
You first need to have a Fortran compiler. I have tested this with `ifort` (Intel® Fortran Compiler Classic), `ifx` (Intel® Fortran Compiler) and `gfortran` (GNU Fortran) and it needs to be visible within your `$PATH`. Second, you need to have [fpm](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) installed, because this is what builds the project. Once you have those, it's as easy as doing `fpm run`.
