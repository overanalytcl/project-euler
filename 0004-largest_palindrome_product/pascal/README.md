# Largest Palindrome Product

## Statement

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two $2$-digit numbers is $9001 = 91 \times 99$.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two $3$-digit numbers.

## Instructions
You need to have the Free Pascal compiler installed and have the executables visible within your `$PATH`. Optional (but highly recommended) is the Lazarus IDE.

You can either do:
```shell
fpc largestpalindromeproduct.lpr -olargestpalindromeproduct
./largestpalindromeproduct
```
or, if you have Lazarus (you can also open this .lpi file and build it from within the IDE and then execute the resulting executable from a terminal):
```shell
lazbuild largestpalindromeproduct.lpi
./largestpalindromeproduct
```
